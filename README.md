- **AI-Driven Routing**: Optimize data routing and bandwidth allocation in real-time.
- **Edge Computing**: Deploy quantum-enabled edge nodes to enhance connectivity in underserved regions.

## Installation Instructions

To set up the Quantum Nexus Infrastructure on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   1. git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/QuantumNexus-Infra.git
   2. cd QuantumNexus-Infra
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**: It is recommended to use a virtual environment. You can create one using venv:

   ```bash
   1. python -m venv venv
   2. source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required packages using pip:

   ```bash
   1. pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configuration**: Modify the configuration files in the config/ directory to suit your network and protocol requirements.
