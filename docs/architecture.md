   - Responsible for generating and distributing quantum keys securely.
   - Utilizes quantum entanglement and photon polarization techniques.
   - Interfaces with the main application to provide secure communication channels.

2. **AI Routing Engine**
   - Implements machine learning algorithms to optimize data routing.
   - Analyzes network traffic in real-time to allocate bandwidth efficiently.
   - Communicates with edge nodes to ensure optimal data paths.

3. **Edge Computing Nodes**
   - Deployed in various geographical locations to enhance connectivity.
   - Process data locally to reduce latency and bandwidth usage.
   - Interact with the QKD module and AI routing engine for secure data handling.

4. **User  Interface**
   - Provides a web-based dashboard for users to monitor network status and performance.
   - Allows users to configure settings and view analytics.

## Data Flow

1. **Key Generation**: The QKD module generates quantum keys and distributes them to the edge nodes.
2. **Data Transmission**: Users send data through the AI routing engine, which determines the best path based on current network conditions.
3. **Local Processing**: Edge nodes process the data locally, applying the quantum keys for encryption.
4. **Feedback Loop**: The AI routing engine continuously learns from network performance, adjusting routing algorithms as needed.
